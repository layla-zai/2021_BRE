### Read In Data 

Read in the table `insurance.tsv` that came along with the homework. This is a dataset from kaggle, <https://www.kaggle.com/mirichoi0218/insurance>, a great website that has a ton of open access data sets that you can use. This data has insurance costs for individuals, along with some demographic and health information on them. The columns are:

- **age**: age of primary beneficiary
- **sex**: insurance contractor gender, female, male
- **bmi**: Body mass index, providing an understanding of body, weights that are relatively high or low relative to height, objective index of body weight (kg / m ^ 2) using the ratio of height to weight, ideally 18.5 to 24.9
- **children**: Number of children covered by health insurance / Number of dependents
- **smoker**: Smoking, yes/no
- **region**: the beneficiary's residential area in the US, northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest.
- **charges**: Individual medical costs billed by health insurance

### Practice New Correlation and Linear Model Tests

For this section, use the given statistical test to answer the question and return a `tidy()` table as the a. Put the code for the statistical test in the chunk below the question and explain whether the test is positive (p-values < 0.05 are our significance threshold) or not where it says *TYPE YOUR CONCLUSION HERE*. Remember if you're using more than one variable to include your conclusions for all of them. In addition to the statistical test, before answering each question in this section, you must do a Q-Q plot to check the linearity of all the relevant variables.

---

1. Is age correlated with insurance charges? Use a correlation test.

*TYPE YOUR CONCLUSION HERE* There is a positive correlation between age and insurance, but it is not a very strong relationship. It is statistically significant.  

```{r}
### Q-Q plot
ggplot(insurance, aes(sample = age)) +
  geom_qq() +
  geom_qq_line() +
  theme_classic()
ggplot(insurance, aes(sample = charges)) +
  geom_qq() +
  geom_qq_line() +
  theme_classic()
### test
cor.test(insurance$age, insurance$charges) %>% tidy()
```

2. Is age associated with both bmi and the number of children an individual has? Use an additive linear model

*TYPE YOUR CONCLUSION HERE* Age is positively correlated to both bmi and the number of children an individual has. 

```{r}
### Q-Q plot
ggplot(insurance, aes(sample = age)) +
  geom_qq() +
  geom_qq_line() +
  theme_minimal()
 
ggplot(insurance, aes(sample = bmi)) +
  geom_qq() +
  geom_qq_line() +
  theme_minimal()

ggplot(insurance, aes(sample = children)) +
  geom_qq() +
  geom_qq_line() +
  theme_minimal()
### test
lm(age ~ bmi + children, data = insurance) %>% tidy()
```

3. Is an interaction between age and bmi associated with higher insurance charges? Use an interactive linear model.

```{r}
ggplot(insurance, aes(sample = age)) +
  geom_qq() +
  geom_qq_line() +
  theme_minimal()

ggplot(insurance, aes(sample = bmi)) +
  geom_qq() +
  geom_qq_line() +
  theme_minimal()

ggplot(insurance, aes(sample = charges)) +
  geom_qq() +
  geom_qq_line() +
  theme_minimal()
### test
lm(charges ~ age:bmi, data = insurance) %>% tidy()
```

4. Reconsidering the question from 3, are there unique interactive and additive effects from age and bmi on insurance charges? Use a single linear model that checks all additive and interaction effects.

```{r}
ggplot(insurance, aes(sample = age)) +
  geom_qq() +
  geom_qq_line() +
  theme_minimal()
ggplot(insurance, aes(sample = bmi)) +
  geom_qq() +
  geom_qq_line() +
  theme_minimal()
ggplot(insurance, aes(sample = charges)) +
  geom_qq() +
  geom_qq_line() +
  theme_minimal()

lm(charges ~ age*bmi, data = insurance) %>% tidy()
```

<br>

### Use Model Results to Make a Prediction

5. Using the model you created in question 2, read in the table `new_insurance_data.tsv` and apply your model to it to predict the age of the individuals in the table. How accurate is it?

*TYPE YOUR CONCLUSION HERE* It is extremely accurate. For example, one of the accurate ages is 2 and the model predicted 2. 

```{r}
read_tsv('data/new_insurance_data.tsv') -> new_insurance_data

lm(age ~ bmi + children, data = insurance) -> model
new_insurance_data %>%
  mutate(prediction = predict(model, newdata = new_insurance_data)) -> new_pred

new_pred %>%
  mutate(diff = prediction - age) %>%
  summarize(mae = mean(abs(diff)))

# plot
ggplot(new_pred, aes(x = age, y = prediction)) + 
  geom_abline(slope = 1, intercept = 0, linetype = 'dashed', color = 'gray60') +
  geom_point() +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0,6), ylim = c(0, 6)) +
  labs(x = 'Actual Age', y = 'Predicted Age') +
  theme_bw()
```

### Which model is best?

In this section you'll create a series of models, report their parameters and then have to pick the best model using the model parameters reported. We interested in seeing if age, bmi, and the number of children an individual has effects their total insurance charges.

---

6. Report the model parameters for the additive model

```{r}
lm(charges ~ age + bmi + children, data = insurance) %>% glance()
```

7. Report the model parameters for the interaction model

```{r}
lm(charges ~ age:bmi:children, data = insurance) %>% glance()
```

8. Report the model parameters for the combination of additive and interaction effects

```{r}
lm(charges ~ age*bmi*children, data = insurance) %>% glance()
```

9. Which model is best? Support your argument using the model parameters. Also, are these good models? Do they offer a lot of explanatory power for insurance charges?

*TYPE YOUR CONCLUSION HERE* The additive model seems to be best because it the most concise and has a high adjusted R^2 value. It's also easier to interpret.

### Come Up With Your Own Questions

For this last section, come up with **three** more questions about the insurance data. For each question you'll need to both make a plot and pick an appropriate statistical test to answer it. Any test discussed in the course so far is fair game.

10. Pick a question to answer with a statistical test. Write down both your question and the test you'll use below.

**Question:** Does the effect of age on insurance charges depend on where a person lives? 
**Test:** Linear model

Use the chunk below to run your statistical test. What is your conclusion?

*TYPE YOUR CONCLUSION HERE* Insurance charges increases with age, but the rate of increase can be greater in certain regions like the northwest and southeast regions.

```{r}
ggplot(insurance, aes(x = age, y = charges, color = region)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Charges vs Age by Region")

lm(charges ~ age * region, data = insurance) %>% tidy()
```

11. Pick a question to answer with a statistical test. Write down both your question and the test you'll use below.

**Question:** Does smoking status have a significant effect on insurance charges? 
**Test:** Linear model

Use the chunk below to run your statistical test. What is your conclusion?

*TYPE YOUR CONCLUSION HERE* Smoking status does have a statistically significant effect on insurance charges. Smokers are charged approximately $23,000 more than non-smokers. 

```{r}
ggplot(insurance, aes(sample = charges)) +
  geom_qq() +
  geom_qq_line() +
  theme_minimal()

model <- lm(charges ~ smoker, data = insurance)
summary(model)

tidy(model)
```

12. Pick a question to answer with a statistical test. Write down both your question and the test you'll use below.

**Question:** Is there a correlation between the number of children a person has and the insurance charge? 
**Test:** Linear model

Use the chunk below to run your statistical test. What is your conclusion?

*TYPE YOUR CONCLUSION HERE* There is a significant positive correlation between the number of children a person has and their insurance charge. For each child, the insurance charge increases by about $790. 

```{r}
ggplot(insurance, aes(sample = charges)) +
  geom_qq() +
  geom_qq_line() +
  theme_minimal()

model_children <- lm(charges ~ children, data = insurance)

tidy(model_children)
```
